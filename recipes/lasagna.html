    <p>I was laying in bed when I was craving something savory. I decided I would make lasagna like my mother used to make.</p>
    <p>This lasagna will make your mouth water the whole time you are trying to cook it. The meat sauce gives it that perfect acidity and savor.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Cheese Filling</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>15 oz. ricotta cheese, 2 cups</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 cups mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>3/4 cup Parmesan cheese, freshly grated</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Meat sauce</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 yellow onion, finely diced</li>
        <li>3/4 lb. ground beef</li>
        <li>3/4 lb. ground Italian sausage</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>40 oz. marinara sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon hot sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Lasagna Noodles/ Cheese Topping</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles, plus extra in case of breakage</li>
        <li>2.5 cups mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Equipment</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 9x13-inch casserole dish</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Prep Work</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Combine the cheese filling ingredients</strong> in a medium bowl and set aside.<br>Measure out remaining ingredients</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Make the Meat Sauce</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Heat olive oil</strong> over medium heat and <strong>add the diced onions.</strong> Let them soften for 10 minutes. (This allows them to release a little sugar which is a nice offset to the acidity of the tomatoes.)</li>
        <li><strong>Add the ground beef and sausage</strong> and increase heat to medium-high. Use a spatula to break up the meat so that it's very fine and crumbled. Cook for 8-10 minutes, or until cooked through. <strong>Add garlic</strong> during the last minute. Drain excess grease.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the chicken broth</strong> and use a silicone spatula to "clean" the bottom and sides of the pot. <strong>Add the marinara sauce, tomato paste, hot sauce, and Worcestershire sauce.</strong> Bring to a boil, then reduce to asimmer. Cover partially and let the sauce simmer gently while you boil the pasta noodles.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Preheat the Oven and Cook the Lasagna Noodles</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to <strong>375 degrees.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Begin boiling a large pot of salted pasta water</strong> for the lasagna noodles. Once a rapid boil is reached,  <strong>cook the noodles to al dente</strong> according to package instructions. (Set a timer to ensure you don't overcook them.) Gently stir with a wooden spoon throughout cooking to prevent the noodles from sticking. <strong>Drain and rinse with cold water </strong> until noodles are completely cool.</li>
        <li>Lay the cooled noodles flat on wax or parchment paper while you begin assembling the lasagna.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Assemble</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Spread 1 heaping cup of meat sauce</strong> on the bottom of a 9 x 13-inch casserole dish. Next, <strong>add 4 lasagna noodles,</strong> overlapping them if needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Spread 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture</strong> over the noodles, followed by about <strong>1 1/2 cups of meat sauce.</strong></li>
        <li>Top with <strong>4 more lasagna noodles, 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture, 1 1/2 cups meat sauce.</strong></li>
        <li>Finish with <strong>4 more lasagna noodles, the rest of the ricotta mixture,</strong> and <strong>the rest of the meat sauce.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Top with 2 1/2 cups of Mozzarella cheese</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Spray foil with nonstick cooking spray</strong> and place it spray-side-down on top of the baking dish to prevent the cheese from sticking to it.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Bake</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Bake for 35 minutes.</strong> <em> Remove cover</em> and <strong>bake for 10 more minutes.</strong></li>
        <li>Remove and garnish with fresh parsley. <strong>Let it sit for 15 minutes prior to serving </strong> to allow the layers to set. Serve with garlic bread with cheese.</li>
    </ol>
