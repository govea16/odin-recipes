    <p><strong>BANG BANG CHICKEN BITES!</strong> If I could only eat one thing for the rest of my life. This would be it. The sauce used for this is a mixture of my two favorite flavors. Sriracha and sweet chili sauce.</p>
    <p>If you want to experience the classic Sriracha taste, opt for Golden Dragon Sriracha instead. This is the farm that Sriracha used to buy their red Jalapeño peppers from before they changed their receipe in that late 2010s. </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>24 ounces frozen crispy chicken nuggets</li>
        <li>1/2 cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons sweet chili sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Srirach hot sauce, plus more if desired</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sliced green onions</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your air fryer to 300 degrees</li>
        <li>Add nuggets in a single layer to the air fryer basket, and fry until hot and crisp, about 10 minutes, shaking the basket halfway through the cooking time. You may need to work in batches. (Alternately, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Place nuggets in a single layer on a baking sheet, and bake in the preheated oven until golden, about 12 minutes.)</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, stir mayonnaise, chili sauce, and hot sauce together in a large bowl until well blended. Toss hot chicken nuggets in sauce until well coated. top with green onions before serving.</li>
    </ol>
